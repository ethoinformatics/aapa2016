# AAPA Ethoinformatics presentation outline

## Ethoinformatics I (Kenny)

### Notes (based on Journal Club feedback):

Emphasize what is new. What new questions or analysis can be tackled? (David Strait)


### Hypothetical data examples

1. Portal for discovering and mining primatological data (e.g., body weights)

2. Interface for adding corresponding data to custom research data (e.g., grooming events)

3. Interface for adding related data to custom research data (e.g., abundance of predators via GBIF)

### Primatology is comparative and complex

### What is Ethoinformatics?

### Background on data models and data formats (breaking the table)

* Table demo

* JSON demo

	* Show that JSON can display the same information, but is more flexible

### Background on RDF and linked data

### Introduction to the Etho Core vocabulary

* Event: data are temporal

* Location: data are geospatial

* MeasurementOrObservation: observational data are complex																			

### What is new/what is possible?
